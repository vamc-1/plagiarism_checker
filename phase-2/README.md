# C++ Plagiarism Checker (Phase 2)

## Requirements

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential llvm-dev libclang-dev
```
# Step 1: Compile the plagiarism engine objects
```bash
  g++ -std=c++20 \
    -I/usr/lib/llvm-16/include \
    -L/usr/lib/llvm-16/lib \
    tokenizer.cpp phase2_1.cpp main.cpp \
    -o plagiarism_checker \
    -lclang -pthread -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib/llvm-16/lib
```
# Step 2: Run multiple comparisons
 ```bash
 ./plagiarism_checker .
```


# Example Output (Phase 2)
 ```
  Testcase Execution Started
Loading students from: ./students.txt

Student added: Alice
Student added: Bob
Student added: Charlie
Student added: chintu
Student added: vamsi
Student added: kako3

Loading professors from: ./professors.txt
Professor added: Dr.Smith
Professor added: Dr.Johnson

Loading original submissions from: ./originals.txt
Original submission: ID=1, Student=Alice, Professor=Dr.Smith, File=phase2_1.cpp
Original submission: ID=2, Student=Bob, Professor=Dr.Johnson, File=tokenizer.cpp

Processing New Submissions:
Time: 1.50 | Processing submission ID=3 from chintu for Prof. Dr.Smith (phase2_1.cpp)
Time: 2.10 | Processing submission ID=4 from Charlie for Prof. Dr.Smith (phase2_2.cpp)

Checking submission ID=3 from chintu for Prof. Dr.Smith (./phase2_1.cpp)
Time: 2.10 | Processing submission ID=5 from vamsi for Prof. Dr.Johnson (main.cpp)
Time: 3.30 | Processing submission ID=6 from kako3 for Prof. Dr.Johnson (tokenizer.cpp)

Student Flagged: I was flagged in phase2_1.cpp and must defend myself in front of Prof. Dr.Smith.
Plagiarism Detected: Student chintu has plagiarized in phase2_1.cpp and will be receiving an FR grade.
Plagiarism (submitted later): ID=3 suspected source ID=1

Checking submission ID=4 from Charlie for Prof. Dr.Smith (./phase2_2.cpp)
Submission ID=4 could not be processed (tokenization failed).

Checking submission ID=5 from vamsi for Prof. Dr.Johnson (./main.cpp)
Submission ID=5 is clean.

Checking submission ID=6 from kako3 for Prof. Dr.Johnson (./tokenizer.cpp)
Student Flagged: I was flagged in tokenizer.cpp and must defend myself in front of Prof. Dr.Johnson.
Plagiarism Detected: Student kako3 has plagiarized in tokenizer.cpp and will be receiving an FR grade.
Plagiarism (submitted later): ID=6 suspected source ID=2
